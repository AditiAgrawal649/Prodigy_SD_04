## ðŸ“˜ About the Project

This project demonstrates how classic backtracking algorithms can be applied to solve Sudoku puzzles. It takes a 9x9 grid as input and fills in the empty cells (represented by 0s) to complete the puzzle according to Sudoku rules.

## ðŸŽ¯ Features

- Accepts any solvable 9x9 Sudoku puzzle
- Uses efficient backtracking algorithm
- Neatly prints the solved puzzle to the console
- Easy to modify and integrate into GUI/desktop apps

## ðŸ§  Algorithm Used

The backtracking algorithm works by:
1. Finding the first empty cell
2. Trying all valid numbers (1 to 9)
3. Placing a number if it does not violate the Sudoku rules
4. Recursively attempting to fill the rest of the board
5. Backtracking when a dead end is encountered
